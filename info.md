# My Rail Commute

A custom Home Assistant integration that tracks regular commutes using National Rail real-time data from the Darwin API. Monitor train services, get disruption alerts, and automate your commuting routine.

## Features

- **Real-time Train Tracking**: Monitor upcoming train services between any two UK rail stations
- **Smart Update Intervals**: Automatically adjusts polling frequency based on time of day (peak/off-peak/night)
- **Disruption Detection**: Binary sensor that alerts on cancellations or significant delays
- **Rich Sensor Data**: Comprehensive attributes including platforms, delays, calling points, and more
- **Multi-Route Support**: Configure multiple commutes (e.g., morning and evening journeys)
- **UI Configuration**: Easy setup through Home Assistant's config flow interface
- **Custom Lovelace Card**: Dedicated dashboard card available at [lovelace-my-rail-commute-card](https://github.com/adamf83/lovelace-my-rail-commute-card)

## Sensors

The integration creates three sensors for each configured commute:

1. **Commute Summary Sensor** - Overview of all tracked services
2. **Next Train Sensor** - Detailed information about the next departure
3. **Severe Disruption Binary Sensor** - Alerts when disruption is detected
